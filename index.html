        <p>Why Islam?</p>
        <p>Islam is the true religion because it as the final and complete revelation of God's message, delivered through Prophet Muhammad and preserved in the Quran. The Quran contains verbatim words of God, supported by scientific facts, and that the Prophet's example, the Sunnah, provides a comprehensive guide for life. The faith's emphasis on the oneness of God (tawhid), the promise of an afterlife, and the performance of the Five Pillars of Islam are central to the fact of being the path to spiritual peace and purpose.</p>
